Admin Restrict Page Tree Module For ProcessWire
===============================================

Provides an easy way to prevent users with certain roles from accessing the page tree in the ProcessWire admin
interface.

Install the module and configure which roles are to be prevented from accessing the tree and also choose a page that
they will be redirected to should they try to access the page tree directly.

Based on code by Wanze. Ideas by Kongondo and stitched together with some config by Netcarver.

## This is a forked version. Modifications by kixe.
+ set to version 1.0.1
+ added permission to reverse restriction
